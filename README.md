An example Vue application.

The code is intended to follow best practices, but it is only a small application and decisions about what is 'best' need to be judged in that context.

There will undoubtedly be mistakes in the code. You can report any you find by [opening an issue](https://github.com/skirtles-code/vue-numbers-game/issues).
